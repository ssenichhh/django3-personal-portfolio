## Personal Portfolio

This personal portfolio site is built using Django, a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. The site is designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional experience, and it features several key sections:

## Key Features

- **Home Page:** Provides a brief introduction about myself, highlighting my skills as a Python Full-Stack Developer.

- **Blog:** A section where I post articles about my experiences, projects, and insights into full-stack development. This section is dynamically managed and allows for easy updates and additions through the Django admin panel.

- **Resume:** A detailed resume that outlines my professional experience, education, and skills. The resume is accessible directly from the site and can be downloaded.

- **Job Experience:** A comprehensive list of my job experiences, detailing the roles and responsibilities I have undertaken in various projects. This section is also managed via the Django admin panel, making it easy to update as I gain more experience.

- **Contact Form:** A form that allows visitors to get in touch with me directly from the site. The form collects the visitor's name, email, and message, and sends it to my email address for follow-up.

## Technologies Used

- **Front-end:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Back-end:** Django, Python
- **Database:** SQLite

## Administration
